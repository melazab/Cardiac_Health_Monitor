# Cardiac_Health_Monitor
The Cardiac Health Monitor is a wearable biosensor that measures 
plethysmography (PPG) using the Renesas OB1203 sensor module and 
wirelessly transmits data to a Bluetooth enabled smartphone. Data from
the OB1203 is used to transmit heart rate, oxygen saturation and
breathing rate. The device is built on Microchip's WBZ451 Curiosity 
board which features a 64 MHz ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit microcontroller.
